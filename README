BC Version 3 - Recursive Decent Parser

Program Functions:
  - This program is a recursive decent parser that calculates basic math
    equations with correct precedence. It can do {+,-,*,/,%,^,unary minus}
  - It also incorporates a symbol table to hold all the identifiers and their
    values.

Compile:
  - To Compile run:   make
      - This will created a bc file.
  - To delete old compiler files run:   make clean

Run:
  - To run type: bc
  - To run with I/O redirection type : bc < name_of_input_file > name_of_output_file

Use:
  - dump - prints the contents of the symbol table to the screen.
  - quit - gracefully exits the program
  - To input equations:
      - ALL Equations should start with an id=equation
      - Where the id is 1 or more character to make the identifier
        and equation is the math expression to calculate.
        EX: a=2+3   or  dog=4/2   or   csc=12
